# Fontys-ISSD
Android application (Java) aimed at Fontys students/teachers and ISSD employees where products from ISSD can easily be borrowed and appointments can be made to pick-up and return the product.

**ISSD**

The ICT Studenten Service Desk (ISSD) is a helpdesk for all students and teachers of Fontys ICT. At the ISSD you can borrow all sorts of hardware, varying from Macbooks to Raspberry PI's. You can borrow whatever is needed for your courses.

Fontys students/teachers should be able to see the products available to borrow from ISSD, select a product, and select the period they would like to borrow it for. It can also be possible to extend the time you want to borrow the product in case a project is not yet finished.
